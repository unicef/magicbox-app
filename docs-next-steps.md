# Magicbox App: Next Steps

### Whatâ€™s next

This app has the potential to be a fully-customizable, but easy to use map-building application (potentially with some light analysis functions also), as well as be a foundation for similar, more robust software projects.

There are two main use cases that we see as important future steps:

- The ability for an organization, division, or team to create and maintain a completely custom map application that either acts as an internal tool for monitoring or management or as an education or advocacy tool
- The ability for individual users to make and share more basic maps that provides simple information and kepler functionality such as colored points, polygons, filtering, layer toggling, etc.

In order to achieve this, additional features would have to be build upon the existing framework, which was designed with this future in mind. Below is an outline of potential next steps we had in mind when architecting this software.


1. Dynamic Views: frontend and backend updates
    1. add open data to maps
    2. being able to choose dynamic view vs. a map of a moment in time  
    3. streaming/real-time data
2. User-created maps: saving & sharing
    1. make UNICEF/private data accessible to staff to create their own maps
3. Public vs. internal versions: auth
    1. add UNICEF/private data to maps
4. Content management for UNICEF thematic maps (i.e. updating descriptive content, etc.)
