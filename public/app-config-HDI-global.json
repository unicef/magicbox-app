Traditional methods of collecting such estimates, however, are both time-consuming and expensive. Here, we outline a complementary approach. The map shows poverty estimated using novel sources of data such as social media, mobile phones, and satellite images. It uses techniques from machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) to estimate the poverty at sub-national scales and understand its temporal dynamics."

In this first version of the map we only focus on composite measures of poverty (HDI), but we are working on incorporating all the definitions. The traditional method for collecting poverty data is using surveys, where questioners go from household to household, typically visiting thousands of households, interviewing the inhabitants asking them questions about their spending and consumption patterns, the assets they own, and many other related factors which are later condensed into a measure of poverty. Surveys generate amazing data, but they are time consuming, expensive, and some places might not even be surveyed because they are impossible to reach (e.g. in the case of conflicts). As such, they are only performed once every 5, 10, 15, or in some cases every 20 years, depending on the country; however, fundamental changes in the demographic makeup of countries can occur on much shorter timescales. Here, we are testing out how machine learning and AI techniques can keep poverty estimates up-to-date and help us bridge the gap between consecutive surveys."

These 'new' data sources include social media data, mobile phone traces, or satellite images. This first iteration of this map shows our efforts of using anonymous and aggregated Twitter data to estimate poverty. We use different variables including the adoption rate, how frequent and at what times tweets are posted (morning, day, night), and human mobility patterns."

First, not everybody uses Twitter; in fact, we know the platform is biased towards wealthy population demographics. Nevertheless, we have previously shown that it can be applied to map unemployment. Second, Twitter is not used everywhere. We have selected nine countries with good Twitter coverage: Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Indonesia, Mexico, Nepal, Nigeria, Pakistan, and Poland. Scaling models globally to countries where Twitter is not used will not work. To remedy this, we are also looking into complementary approaches. One approach looks into using call patterns. This has previously been documented to work well in specific settings; however, call data can also be biased and gaining access can be difficult. Another approach focuses on satellite images which enable us to get global coverage. Nevertheless, analyzing images with deep learning algorithms can sometime leave you with more questions than answers-understanding why a deep learning algorithm returns a specific value is not always easy. The last approach, a work in progress, looks into combinations of any of these three, e.g. can we combine social media data with satellite images to make estimations more robust, representative, and transparent?"
